# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

- GAN are neural network to generate materials (such as music, image, text etc)

- GAN consist of two neural networks: 1. Trained to generate data (Generator), and 2. Trained to distinguish fake data from real data: Adversarial of the network (Discriminator).

There are different types of GAN according to usage, however the most popular ones are:
- Vanilla GAN: Basic GAN
- CycleGAN: Image to image translation. For example transforming horse to zebra.
- StyleGAN
- PixelRNN
- text-2-image
- DiscoGAN
- IsGAN
